Project Proposal

Executive Summary

This project aims to facilitate farmers, especially smallholder farmers, through use of technology allowing for improvement in productivity, yield and quality of the produce.

Objectives

-> Providing smallholder farmers with a market
-> Reducing the role of middlemen
-> Improve the productive processes through technology
-> Improving the quality and yield in agriculture
-> Farm automation
-> Precise Agriculture:  Providing more accurate techniques for planting and growing crops, enables farmers to increase efficiency and manage costs



Project Plan 

Many farmers do not have the necessary equipment or technology to keep up with the ever-increasing demand or, they do not have a reliable source for accessing the market status.
Many face the issue of financial instability due to fluctuating market prices. 
Some farmers only realise 8-10% of their product's final value, it means that the farmers are only receiving a small fraction of the total price that the end consumer pays for their produce. 

The common reasons for these problems include:

Lack of market information:  Farmers may not have access to the latest market information, including prices and demand trends, which can result in them being unaware of the actual value of their products.

Middlemen and brokers:  Middlemen and brokers may exploit farmers by purchasing their products at a low price and selling them at a higher price to markets and customers. This leads to a situation where farmers are not able to earn a fair price for their produce.

We present the following solutions in order to address these issues :

Provide farmers with current market information, including prices and demand trends, through various channels such as emails, SMS alerts, and a dedicated blog section providing information on various topics that allow them to get a clear grasp on things.

Setting up direct marketing channels between farmers and markets to reduce the role of middlemen and brokers. Directly contacting the farmers for selling their products. Providing delivery services that are quick and safe, reducing spoilage.

Allowing farmers to decide the price, by filling up the product details, quantity & the price they would offer for their products and ensuring farmers get the true value of their products.

Facilitate the empowerment of smallholder farmers/products through assistance for mobilisation, organisation into associations, cooperatives etc. for their increased participation in planning, marketing, technology dissemination and agro-processing etc.

Facilitate market interventions for value addition to farm produce.
	


Providing Crop and Season data.

Our website provides information about different crops, including planting and harvesting schedules, recommended fertilisers, and pest control measures. We also provide seasonal updates and weather forecasts, so that farmers can plan their operations accordingly.



Export and Delivery Services.

We offer export services that connect farmers with buyers from around the world, allowing them to increase their income and improve their livelihoods. In addition, we provide delivery services to ensure that products are transported safely and efficiently.



We also provide a donation program for financial aid to farmers in need.

Farmers may face financial ruin or a possibility of years of debt due to a bad harvest or climate instability. There is also climate risk thatâ€™s affecting agriculture and therefore the livelihood of many farmers.		

The problem of climate risk in agriculture arises from the fact that climate change is causing changes in weather patterns, leading to extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, storms, and heatwaves. These events can have severe consequences on crop yields, livestock production, and farmer livelihoods.



To help farmers in critical situations, such as natural disasters, crop failures, or unexpected expenses, we introduced a donation program with transparent and accountable financial practices.
During the registering process we collect the necessary information from farmers to determine their eligibility for support. The funds are distributed equally among all the registered farmers in need to help them in the climate crisis .
